It regards Unet as the original network, uses three pre-training models of VGG, ResNet, and Res2Net respectively, adds Edge Attention (EA) module, Parallel Partial Decoder (PPD) module and Reverse Attention (RA) module, and improves the loss function at the same time. Pre-training models can reduce the model's demand for training data and improve training accuracy; the Edge Attention module can extract contour information; the Parallel Partial Decoder module can fuse multi-size advanced features to enrich feature information; Reverse Attention module can integrate high and low level feature information to extract more feature information; the improved loss function can increase the weight of complex pixels, so that the network can segment more complex lesion areas. The highest accuracy of this network on the test set is 0.9922, which is higher than the original network Unet (0.9769). It shows that the improvement measures for the Unet network in this article are efficient.
